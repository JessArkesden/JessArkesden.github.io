    "text": "1. Introduction\nGreenspace is an important part of urban life, with benefits for humans and the environment. Analysing Bradford local authority district (LAD), this study builds on the growing literature addressing the challenge of greenspace accessibility by focusing on each deprivation dimension. Results show that considering deprivation and the relationship with greenspace in this greater level of detail is important for future policy and development."

    "section": "2. Background",
    "text": "2. Background\n\n2.1. Why is greenspace important?\nNatural England (2023) estimates benefits of £6.6 billion in health, climate, and environmental gains from greenspace. However, a third of people do not have access to quality greenspace within a 15-minute walk of their home (Natural England, 2023). Public policy highlights commitments to improve this, with the Green Infrastructure Framework seeking to determine where greenspace is needed (Natural England, 2023).\n\n\n2.2. Why Bradford?\nBradford is the fifth largest district in England (CBMDC, 2021) and has a young population, ranking 4th for children aged 14 or less (21.4%) (CBMDC, 2022). Bradford is diverse – a third of people identify as Muslim, nearly 20% were born outside the UK, and 39% are Black, Asian, Mixed, or “Other” non-White ethnicities (ONS, 2023h). Over a fifth of the population have poor health, and a fifth are disabled (ONS, 2023h).\nGreenspace assets include extensive moorland and woodland as well as 36 council recognised parks (CBMDC, 2019). There are sports grounds and facilities, but not all are freely accessible. Limited utilisation data exists, but estimates suggest it is below national and regional averages, with surveys finding those most likely to utilise urban greenspace were ethnic minorities, households without a car, and people with children (CBMDC, 2019).\nThe council recognise the need to embed greenspace within long-term strategies. Key ambitions include ensuring greenspaces are safe and inclusive, improving health outcomes by prioritising investment for those most in need (CBMDC, 2021).\n\n\n2.3. Review of current literature\nAn increasing body of literature acknowledges the connection between greenspace access and overall health (Jia et al, 2021; Lachowycz and Jones, 2011; McCormick, 2017) and social benefits, including community cohesion (Barbosa et al, 2007). Methodologies vary, but most find deprived communities have the best access whilst utilisation levels are unclear, but perception of quality can limit use (Barbosa et al, 2007; Jones et al, 2009; Kessel et al, 2009; Roe et al, 2016). This quality issue is worse in deprived areas (Gidlow and Ellis, 2011; Mears et al, 2019).\nSeveral Bradford-specific studies exist. Mueller et al (2018) analysed health impacts and determined greenspace promotes an active lifestyle, and helps mitigate pollution, noise, and heat effects. McEachan et al (2018) demonstrated the positive impact greenspace had on children, but this impact differed by ethnicity, and perceived quality of greenspace was more important than quantity. Perception has also been linked to biodiversity and facilities (Wood et al, 2018)."

    "text": "3. Research question\nNo literature reviewed analyses the dimensions of deprivation. This study aims to investigate whether there is a statistically significant relationship between greenspace access and each dimension of the 2021 UK Census deprivation measure. The null hypothesis is that there is not a statistically significant relationship present.\nThe remainder of this notebook will be structured as follows: Section 4 explains the datasets used; Section 5 outlines data wrangling processes preparing for analysis; Section 6 presents visual analyses and statistical descriptors of the data; Section 7 includes analysis and results of the OLS regression, Moran’s I and LISA cluster evaluation, and subsequent GWR model; Section 8 discusses findings, how this could influence policy, and further opportunities to improve this study; Section 9 draws conclusions from the findings."

Import each datafile\nLinks to datafiles are located in the appendix to this notebook and can be downloaded and saved locally using the links provided.\n\n4.2.1. Output Areas (OAs)\nOAs are the lowest census geography level, containing 40 to 250 households (ONS, 2021), enabling more accurate nearest greenspace measurements, and capturing localised differences in deprivation. Polygons and population weighted centroids (PWCs) are available from the ONS (2023a, 2023b). PWCs are used to measure distance to greenspace as it captures the nearest greenspace for most households. Polygons are aggregated to Bradford LAD level using the ONS (2023c) lookup. This is necessary to reduce the OA PWCs and greenspace to those within Bradford LAD.\n# OA polygons (BFC: Full resolution - clipped to the coastline (Mean High Water mark)) (ONS, 2023a)\nOA_polygons = gpd.read_file('Data/Output_Areas_2021_EW_BFC_V8/OA_2021_EW_BFC_V8.shp')\n\n# OA Population-weighted centroids (ONS, 2023b)\nOA_PWC = gpd.read_file('Data/Output_Areas_2021_PWC_V3/PopCentroids_EW_2021_V3.shp')\n# OA to LSOA to MSOA to LAD lookup (ONS, 2023c)\nOA_lookup = pd.read_csv('Data/Output_Area_Lookup_in_England_and_Wales_v3.csv')\n\n### Error can be ignored - it is because of Welsh spellings in a certain column.\n### This is not relevant to, nor will it affect, this study as these columns/rows will not be used.\n\n\n4.2.2. Greenspace\nGreenspace data (OS, 2023) include site (polygon) and access (point) data. However, not all sites have access data, hence only sites are used to ensure all eligible greenspace is captured. Distance from the PWC to nearest greenspace will be calculated using these polygons. Data includes parks, gardens, sports facilities, and religious grounds, but does not include forests, woodland, moorland or canal and river paths (OS, 2023).\n# Greenspace site polygons (OS, 2023)\nGB_greenspace_site = gpd.read_file('Data/OS Open Greenspace (ESRI Shape File) GB/data/GB_GreenspaceSite.shp')\n\n\n4.2.3. Independent variables\nEach deprivation dimension (education, employment, health and disability, and housing) can be obtained via custom ONS queries (ONS, 2023d; ONS, 2023e; ONS, 2023f; ONS, 2023g). These queries include only Bradford LAD OAs. Each file contains the number of households that are deprived or not deprived, from which percentage of households deprived in each dimension is calculated (Section 5.4.) creating the independent variables for regression modelling.\n# Data for Bradford OAs only, from 2021 Census\n\n# Household deprivation in the education dimension (ONS, 2023d)\nHHD_dep_education_raw = pd.read_csv('Data/2021 Census Data/Household deprived in the education dimension.csv')\n\n# Household deprivation in the employment dimension (ONS, 2023e)\nHHD_dep_employment_raw = pd.read_csv('Data/2021 Census Data/Household deprived in the employment dimension.csv')\n\n# Household deprivation in the health and disability dimension (ONS, 2023f)\nHHD_dep_health_raw = pd.read_csv('Data/2021 Census Data/Household deprived in the health and disability dimension.csv')\n\n# Household deprivation in the housing dimension (ONS, 2023g)\nHHD_dep_housing_raw = pd.read_csv('Data/2021 Census Data/Household deprived in the housing dimension.csv')"

Education deprivation has the largest range, from 2.2% in the least deprived OA to 67.8% in the most deprived. Only education and health dimensions exceed 0% in all OAs. For health, the lowest level of deprivation is 8.8% highlighting how even the most affluent areas are impacted by this.\nEducation, health, and housing have outliers at the higher end, recording maximum values around 65-68%. However, average deprivation levels vary across each dimension, with housing having the lowest average (11.0%) and health the highest (35.4%). There is no consistent distribution or spatial pattern to deprivation across all four dimensions.\n\n\nFigure 6.3.5.

Deprivation variables have a positive correlation with one another, particularly employment and health. Figure 7.1.2. is a coefficient matrix which confirms that the employment and health dimensions have a coefficient of 0.68 which is high and could indicate collinearity. People with poorer health or disabilities are more likely to be out of work (ONS, 2023i) and so, coupled with the high coefficient, it has been determined that collinearity is present between these variables.\n\nFigure 7.1.1.

No distinct relationship is visible with positive and negative residuals ranging from around -250 to +250, across all fitted distance values. This suggests the assumption that the relationship is linear is reasonable, and the variance of the error terms are equal. However, only larger positive residuals exist, meaning the model is not working as well for largest distances in the observed values.\n\n\nFigure 7.1.6.

One extreme outlier was visible in the previous charts, but a Q-Q plot allows for confirmation of other outliers closer to the rest of the data points.

Moran’s I\nMoran’s I is used to detect high and low values concentrated spatially, and the spatial relationship between neighbours is random if zero association is found (Paez and Scott, 2004). Queens weights are used, meaning any OA bordering the given OA is included.\nThe I value is 0.46 and the p-value is 0.001. These are positive and significant respectively, implying distance to nearest greenspace is spatially correlated - higher values and lower values cluster spatially. Figure 7.2.1. shows this on a scatterplot.\n# Calculate the queen weights based on the OA\nw_queen = weights.Queen.from_dataframe(final_df, ids = 'OA21CD')\n# Calculate Moran's I using queen weights\nmi = esda.Moran(final_df['Distance'], w_queen)\n# I value\nprint(f'I value: {mi.I}')\n\n# Significance (p value)\nprint(f'P value: {mi.p_sim}')\n\n\n\nI value\n0.45882055605281585\n\n\n\n\nP value\n0.001\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2.1.

LISA Clusters\nSpatial association will be tested and visualised using Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) clusters. This will be conducted on the dependent variable and residuals from Section 7.1.\n\nDistance\nSignificance is calculated to the 95% level and a LISA cluster assigned. Figure 7.3.1. shows each LISA cluster, with clear spatial patterns emerging. To the north and south, and north of Bradford city centre, there are High-High clusters, meaning these OAs have high distances to the nearest greenspace as do their neighbouring OAs. Meanwhile, Low-Low clusters can be observed around the city of Bradford suburbs and Keighley town centre.\n# Calculate LISA clusters\nlisa_Distance = esda.Moran_Local(final_df['Distance_Clean'], w_queen)\nfinal_df['Sig_Distance'] = lisa_Distance.p_sim &lt; 0.05 # Calculate a variable to show which are significant at the 95% level\nfinal_df['Quad_Distance'] = lisa_Distance.q # Calculate a variable indicating the respective quadrant\n# Create categorical column for the map visual\nfinal_df['LISA_Distance'] = np.select(\n    [\n        (final_df['Sig_Distance'] == False),\n        (final_df['Sig_Distance'] == True) & (final_df['Quad_Distance'] == 1),\n        (final_df['Sig_Distance'] == True) & (final_df['Quad_Distance'] == 2),\n        (final_df['Sig_Distance'] == True) & (final_df['Quad_Distance'] == 3),\n        (final_df['Sig_Distance'] == True) & (final_df['Quad_Distance'] == 4)\n    ],\n    [\n        'Not Significant',\n        'High-High',\n        'Low-High',\n        'Low-Low',\n        'High-Low'\n    ],\n    default='ERROR'  # Return \"ERROR\" string if conditions above are not met\n)\n\n\nFigure 7.3.1.

Positive relationships exist in the northwest, south and suburbs north of Bradford city centre.

Figure 7.4.5. shows the GWR model removed some residual autocorrelation but not all of it. This means some spatial variation has still not been captured.

    "text": "8. Discussion\nResults showed deprivation and distance to greenspace are negatively correlated, reflecting much of the literature, and rejects the null hypothesis posed. However, the relationship differs by dimension and spatially. Any policy or intervention needs to consider this.\nKey differentiators of this study are using deprivation dimensions and OA geographies, attempting to consider distance at a local level appropriate to the Natural England (2023) targets. However, there are limitations and opportunities for improvement.\nFirstly, not all greenspace is considered. Many woodlands, moorlands, river and canal paths are not included but are publicly accessible. Including this would better reflect true greenspace but would also raise consideration of type. Different greenspace serves different purposes – for example, a children’s park versus unmaintained moorland – and so understanding access to different types may further unlock insight into what is within an accessible distance and for whom.\nSecondly, the distance calculation could be improved. Utilising address data to estimate household locations, alongside road and path networks, would allow more accurate calculation of distance to greenspace. This could be an average walk time which would align better to Natural England (2023) targets.\nLastly, two limitations identified in the literature remain: quality and usage. Quality can be subjective and dependent on the greenspace’s purpose. However, a survey recording facilities, amenities, and biodiversity could develop a qualitative understanding. The Natural Environment Scoring Tool (NEST) used in Ferguson et al’s (2018) study provides a starting point. Technological advancements could improve usage data, such as GPS which was used by Mears et al (2021), however data protection, scale, and availability challenges exist.\nDespite these limitations, actions could result from the findings. Deprivation differs by dimension and policy needs to consider this, as well as communities and their needs. These needs will vary by area. This is supported by research conducted on community perceptions (McEachan et al, 2018), highlighting the importance of including communities in decision-making processes.\nFinally, two areas of future research are identified. Firstly, including a broader set of demographic measures beyond deprivation. Age and ethnicity are key, as shown in the literature, but no research addressed in this study has considered variables such as profession which could have an impact on how and when someone accesses greenspace. Secondly, there is opportunity to reflect on the impact of new greenspace, or improvements to current greenspace, to learn and adapt plans. CBMDC (2021) have clear goals they wish to achieve, but understanding the effectiveness of interventions is needed to ensure investments add value. Deprivation can be a relatively slow to change measure. Further studies analysing more reactive variables may enable a comprehensive review of what works in different communities."

    "text": "9. Conclusion\nThis study sought to build on previous research into the relationship between distance to greenspace and deprivation by splitting deprivation into the component dimensions. The findings mirror the literature that there is a statistically significant, negative correlation between distance to greenspace and deprivation, but the use of dimensions and understanding this spatially has shown that the results vary by area. Policy implications are that decisions should be on a local scale, and interventions may vary depending on the community and their needs.\nHowever, this is not only tied to deprivation and this study has argued that a more holistic view of demographics within communities is required, and consideration for the type of greenspace and its uses. This will allow planners to develop better suited solutions to improve community health and wellbeing, with greenspace that meets the needs and wants of the communities they serve."

Analysing Bradford local authority district, this study builds on the growing literature addressing the challenge of greenspace accessibility by focusing on each deprivation dimension recorded in the 2021 Census.\nBradford is a large district, with a young and diverse population. Health and housing inequalities are known issues, whilst greenspace varies across the district in terms of quantity, type and size. The council has embedded greenspace within its long-term strategy, aiming to make sure they are safe, inclusive and that investment is delivered where it is needed most.\nThis study brings together 2021 Census data on each dimension of deprivation (education, employment, health and housing) by Output Area (OA), and combines this with Ordanance Survey data on greenspace in the district. After some initial data wrangling, a series of statistics and visualisations help to illustrate the data that will be used in the subsequent modelling.\nFirst, using an OLS regression model, the variables are analysed to understand the significance of their relationship with access to greenspace - defined here as the distance to the nearest greenspace. This shows that employment deprivation is not statistically significant, and is subsequently removed.\nFurther investigation using a range of techniques, including Moran’s I and LISA clusters, shows that there is spatial autocorrelation present and so a Geographically Weighted Regression model (GWR) is built. The results of this reject the null hypothesis that there is not a statistically significant relationship present between dimensions of deprivation and access to greenspace.\nThis study therefore argues that any future policy interventions need to take into consideration deprivation and its relationship with greenspace.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThis notebook was submitted for assessment within the GEOG5402 Data Science for Urban Systems module as part of the MSc Urban Data Science & Analytics programme at the University of Leeds.\nThe content of this notebook is intended for educational and general use purposes only.\nAny use of the materials should adhere to the guidelines and policies of your educational institution.\nThe author does not take any responsibility for how the materials in this repository are utilised."
