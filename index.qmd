I'm an insight and analytics specialist with nearly a decade of experience across lots of different roles and sectors. I mainly work with geospatial data, and solve problems to help people make better decisions. I love a good map and thinking about the challenges our urban environments face.

In September 2023 I decided to take a career break to expand my skills (like building this website!) and explore new opportunities. I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Urban Data Science & Analytics at the University of Leeds, whilst working as a Freelance Consultant. My studies have deepened my analytical and research capabilities whilst giving me the time and space to delve into all things geospatial!

My aim is to move into sustainable development and use my skills and expertise to help solve problems in our cities!

You can find some of my work, or just things I've been playing around with and trying to learn, on this website.
